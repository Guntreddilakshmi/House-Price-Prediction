# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression techniques. The dataset includes various features like number of rooms, area, location, etc.

## 📌 Project Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Loaded dataset using pandas  
   - Performed basic EDA and cleaned missing values

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Converted categorical data to numeric (if any)
   - Removed unnecessary columns

3. **Modeling**  
   - Used **Linear Regression** model from scikit-learn  
   - Trained and tested using an 80-20 split

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score

5. **Results**  
   - The model shows reasonable performance and can be improved with more features or better data
